Ecotones creates biomes based on factors such as humidity, temperature, elevation, and soil drainage. When put together, these factors create a lot of unique biomes! Ecotones currently adds 70 biomes with over 200 variants. It replaces the vanilla generator so it's currently not compatible most biome mods. However, Terrestria and Traverse are compatible! Ecotones is currently developed for 1.17, and new features most likely won't be backported.

# WARNING

Ecotones is highly in development and things will change with or without notice! Be warned that updating may cause chunk borders or other anomalies. However, Ecotones is perfectly stable and won't crash. This mod does add new blocks and items, so if you want it on a server, any connected clients must also have the mod installed.
